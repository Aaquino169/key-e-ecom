# key-e-ecom

This web application was created using the MERN(Mongodb, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Purpose of the Application

Features such as an online cart customers can populate with Merchendise, simulate a purchase, and add merchendise to sell. This web application is ment for people who are looking to build a custom keyboard.

## User Experience

* The user will be able to click on any merchendise and be redirected to page with a more detailed discription of the clicked item.
